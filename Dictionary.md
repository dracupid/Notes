###**Type Introspection**
The ability of a program to **examine** the type or properties of an object at runtime.

- Using keywords such as `type` `typeof` `instanceof`, or a method or property to possess the ability.

###**Reflection** 
The ability of a program to **examine and modify** its structure and behavior (specifically the values, meta-data, properties and functions) at runtime

- Code can be generated at runtime by variables, instead of hard-coding.
- A key strategy for metaprogramming.
- `eval` is the most straightforward way, but more complicated methods or functions can be used to create a class or get its property whose name is a value or variable .
- In my view, reflection in Javascript may be on of the easist to use.

### **First-Class Citizen**
An entity which supports all the operations generally available to other entities in a language, including being passed as arguments, returned from functions, and assigned to variables or data structures.
- It should be able to be a plain value without a variable name.

### **Parameter & Argument**
Strictly speaking:
- **parameter** means *formal parameter*
- **argument** means *actual parameter*
However, mixing up is acceptable.
